Named after the [Urdu word for revolution,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquilab_Zindabad) Inquilab is a critical computing research lab located at the [Human-Centered Design and Engineering Department](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) of [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). 

Our current research focuses on the themes of [race and migration](https://inquilab.cc/#race--migration), [agriculture](https://inquilab.cc/#agriculture), and [labor](https://inquilab.cc/#labor). Across these areas, we examine how state and market interests often come into conflict with individuals, communities, and social movements—especially through the lens of computation. We interrogate how computational logics are mobilized for subjugation, while also tracing possibilities—and at times co-designing tools—for subversion, appropriation, and refusal. These efforts are part of our broader commitment to imagining and building computing otherwise.

Our work is often rooted in place: we conduct research through ethnography in the Washington region and/or long-term partnerships with social movements both locally and beyond.
