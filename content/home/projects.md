#### Race & migration
This project critically investigates how computational systems—ranging from [search engines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642770) to [electronic ankle monitors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706598.3713261)—participate in the racialization of users by encoding and enacting assumptions about subjectivity. Centering the experiences of racially subjugated migrant populations, it explores how these groups encounter information technologies as extensions of the bureaucratic and carceral functions of the State. At the same time, the project analyzes the sociotechnical infrastructures through which State and industry actors co-produce the perceived omnipresence and authority of these systems. **People:** [Lubna Razaq](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KBMF4rwAAAAJ&hl=en).

#### Agriculture
This project interrogates state and market investments in smart agriculture. In partnership with local movements in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, it examines how AI-based agricultural technologies often [flatten culturally heterogeneous knowledge systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3710911) and farming expertise in the name of resource optimization. What drives these technosolutionist impulses—from cities or industries? And what possibilities exist for diasporic knowledge systems of food and farming to subvert or refuse such erasure? **People:** [McKane Andrus](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSsTq14AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Hanna Barakat](https://www.hbarakat.com/). **Movement partner:** [The Silent Task Force](https://www.thesilenttaskforce.org). **Funding:** [NSF S&CC: Smart & Connected Commun, AISL, 2310515](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2310515&HistoricalAwards=false). 

#### Labor

_Culture of techwork._ In a recently completed project, we began with the provocation: How are labor relations and worker consciousness shifting within the tech industry in the wake of the 2022–23 economic rupture? We theorize this moment of disillusionment among the tech managerial class as [the cruel optimism of tech work](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706598.3713434). **People:** [Samuel So](https://samuelso.net). **Funding:** [NSF IIS-2327163](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2327163&HistoricalAwards=false). **Media coverage:** [KUOW](https://www.kuow.org/stories/layoffs-lost-faith-and-cruel-optimism-in-tech), [Geekwire](https://www.geekwire.com/2025/cruel-optimism-mass-layoffs-take-the-shine-off-careers-in-the-tech-sector-uw-research-finds/), [The Daily](https://www.dailyuw.com/article/what-uw-students-should-know-before-entering-the-tech-industry-20250602).

_Data centers & cloud computing labor._ Another project investigates data centers as sites where computational power is concentrated—a defining feature of the global tech landscape with well-documented ecological impacts. Our focus here is on labor entanglements: how labor sustains, resists, or redefines these infrastructures, and how these dynamics invite us to think more expansively about computing labor, opening up new possibilities for organized resistance. **People:** [Anoolia Gakhokidze](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/anoolia-anny-gakhokidze-519a1775).

_Higher-ed organizing._ This project examines how automation—often implemented by institutional interventions such as AI task forces—reshapes the workplace in higher education. We explore how certain skills are devalued, replaced, or reimagined, and what opportunities remain for organized higher-ed workers to push back. **People:** [Joice Tang](https://joicetang.com/).

#### Reseach and/as Relation
As an ongoing methodological exploration, this project aims to establish relational intimacy and allyship as a core method for responsible engineering and computing research. With this work, we contribute: a comprehensive understanding of how community-engaged researchers relate to their participants as they navigate competing commitments and responsibilities, [a theory of community-centered methods](https://joicetang.com/assets/research_andas_relation.pdf) for design and development that build upon the rhizomatic understanding of Relation, while simultaneously negotiating institutional support within the University of Washington toward community-engaged computing research across the university.

#### Logic(s) x Inquilab
In an ongoing exploration of public scholarship from Inquilab, lab director Sucheta Ghoshal serves as the academic director of the critcal tech magazine [Logic(s)](logicmag.io). Inquilab influence into Logic(s) results in critical tech scholarship that interrogates contemporary computing tools in their materiality while mapping out the social, political, economic, and historical entanglements. **Funding:** INCITE at Columbia University, private donors.

#### The Otherwise School (2021)
[The Otherwise School](https://sites.uw.edu/otherwise/) was a global research initiative towards transnational solidarity and movement building. This project is a collaboration with black study and predictive policing scholar [J. Khadijah Abdurahman](https://incite.columbia.edu/j-khadijah-abdurahman-av). The Otherwise School aims to explore the questions: what would it take for us to build technologies of resistance in the face of an ongoing global crisis of fascism, capitalism, anti-blackness? How can we best locate technology in these intersecting forces of harm?
